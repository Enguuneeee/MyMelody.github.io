			<h3>Who is My Melody?</h3>
			<p>
				My Melody is a sweet little girl bunny who always wears a hood, usually pink, with a cute ribbon or flower on one side.
				She was born in the forest of Mariland and loves baking cookies with her mother, playing with her friends, and spreading kindness wherever she goes.
				Her gentle personality and pastel pink style have made her a beloved character for fans all around the world.
			</p>

			<h3>Her Story &amp; Personality</h3>
			<p>
				My Melody is cheerful, honest, and always tries her best to help others. She enjoys simple, cozy things: warm cookies,
				tea time, writing letters, and spending quiet days with friends. Even when things go wrong, she believes that kindness
				and a gentle heart can make everything better again. Many of her stories and shows are about friendship, forgiveness,
				and staying positive.
			</p>

			<h3>Life in Mariland</h3>
			<p>
				My Melody lives in Mariland, a magical world filled with cute characters, talking animals, and whimsical places.
				From her little home in the forest to the charming streets and castles of Mariland, her world is full of pastel colors,
				sparkles, and soft clouds. In some of her stories, she travels between Mariland and the human world, making new friends
				and learning new lessons along the way.
			</p>

			<h3>My Melody &amp; Her Friends</h3>
			<p>
				My Melody is surrounded by many friends, including Kuromi, who often causes mischief, and other characters who appear
				throughout her shows and adventures. Even when her friends are grumpy or mischievous, My Melody always tries to understand
				them and bring out their good side. Her gentle nature reminds us that everyone deserves kindness.
