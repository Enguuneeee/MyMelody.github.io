					My Melody is rarely alone! Her world is full of friends with different personalities – sweet, shy, loud, and mischievous.
					This page introduces some of the characters who appear in her stories and shows.
				</span>

				<p>
					Each friend brings something unique to My Melody’s life. Some cheer her on, some cause trouble, and some quietly support
					her from the side. Even when they argue or misunderstand each other, their stories always return to kindness, forgiveness,
					and staying close at heart.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Kuromi – The Mischievous Rival</b><br/>
							Kuromi is often seen as My Melody’s rival. She wears a black jester hood with a pink skull on the front and loves planning
							pranks and collecting Dark Power in the shows. Even though she causes trouble, Kuromi has a sensitive side and her
							story shows that even “villains” have feelings and reasons behind their actions.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Baku – Loyal Companion</b><br/>
							Baku is Kuromi’s close partner, a gentle creature who follows her around and helps with her schemes. He may look a little
							clumsy, but he has a good heart and often worries about doing the right thing. His friendship with Kuromi adds humor and
							warmth to My Melody’s adventures.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Flat, Piano, and Other Friends</b><br/>
							Flat is a calm little mouse who is kind and thoughtful, while Piano is a shy sheep who loves soft, cozy things. Along with
							other characters from Mariland and the human world, they support My Melody in quiet ways – listening, helping, and sharing
							cute everyday moments. Together, they create a world where friendship comes in many different shapes and personalities.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					<b>Friendship in My Melody’s World</b><br/>
					The friendships in My Melody’s stories are not always perfect. Sometimes characters feel jealous, lonely, or upset. But through
					talking, apologizing, and trying to understand each other, they grow closer over time. This gentle, emotional side is one of the
					reasons fans love her world so much.
				</p>
